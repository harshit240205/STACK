# STACK
In this we are going to implement the basic function and implementation of stack.
Stack is the one the most important data Structue which can follow the principal of LIFO(last in first out).
- Push (adding the element)
- pop (removing the element)
- top (return the top most element of the stack)
- size (return the size of the stack)
Note: In all the operation we will follow the LIFO Technique.
